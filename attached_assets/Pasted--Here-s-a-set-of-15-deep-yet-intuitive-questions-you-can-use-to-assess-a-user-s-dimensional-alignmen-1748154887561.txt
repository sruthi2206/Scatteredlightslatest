 Here's a set of 15 deep yet intuitive questions you can use to assess a user‚Äôs dimensional alignment (e.g., 3D, 4D, 5D+ consciousness). Each question has two options, one aligning with a 3D-material perspective, and the other with a 5D-expansive/spiritual perspective.

You can design this as a quiz or onboarding flow that reveals their primary dimension based on their dominant choices.
